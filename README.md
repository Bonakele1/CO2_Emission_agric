# CO2 Emission agric
## Total Emission Analysis and Modeling Project

### 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling Average temperature, a measure of carbon dioxide emissions influenced by various human activities, natural processes, and environmental factors. By examining the predictors and their relationships with CO₂ emissions, the analysis aims to identify the primary contributors and provide insights into the dynamics driving environmental changes. Statistical methods and machine learning models are utilized to achieve these objectives.

### 2. Dataset
The dataset contains various predictors that contribute to or are associated with Total Emission levels. It provides comprehensive data on activities related to agriculture, industry, energy, and population demographics across years.

#### Predictors (Features)
